The ADS will take an image or multiple images of paper with a qr code on them and turn them into a pdf file. Artists, teachers, and companies looking to digitize paper resources would use this program. To utilize, first take a picture of the paper you want to turn into a pdf. Then upload the image to the website and download the resulting pdf file. It is needed for uploading many pages at once instead of having to tediously upload pages one at a time while lining up the edges every time.

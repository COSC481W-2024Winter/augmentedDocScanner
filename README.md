The ADS will take an image or multiple images of paper with a qr code on them and turn them into a pdf file. Artists, teachers, and companies looking to digitize paper resources would use this program. To utilize, first take a picture of the paper you want to turn into a pdf. Then upload the image to the website and download the resulting pdf file. It is needed for uploading many pages at once instead of having to tediously upload pages one at a time while lining up the edges every time.

Meet the Team

Michael Werner - Team Lead
I am a 22 year old senior here at Eastern Michigan university. I took on team lead because I wanted a challenge, though I’m sure this class will be a challenge itself. I am looking to go into software development or follow my folks into IT management.

Blake Eastman - Deputy Team Lead

Bryce Sayre - Team Member
Senior Computer Science Major in my last semester at EMU. I like to golf in the summer, and rock climb in the winter. I’m excited to graduate and use the skills I've accrued here at EMU to start a career in software development, and this project seems like a great last step before accomplishing that.

Eric Eisele - Team Member

Gregory Auten - Team Member
Senior Computer Science Major on his last semester at EMU. Love gaming, working out, and programming which I hope to apply the former two things with the latter for when I get work in the future.

Michael Deaunee - Team Member
Senior Computer Science Major on his second to last semester at EMU. I love basketball, videogames, and golfing. I have been learning code for roughly three years and I hope to challenge and utilize the skills i learned for this project.
